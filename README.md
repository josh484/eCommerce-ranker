## Acceptance Criteria
This application will allow the user to create a search for a product of their own choosing and then get results based on their search. The results will be filtered based on the price of the item from cheapest to most expensive so that the user is able to see the best deals for that product.
- The Search bar takes in the use input
- The input is the fed to a few APIs Specifically a data scraper for Amazon, Ebay, etc.
- Take the data from the APIs and then put them into one useState
- Map the data using a card component to the page.
- Make sure the data is sorted based on price. 

### These are features that are not necessary but will help the overall user experience
- Capcha, before the first time the user searches they will be met with a capcha to ensure the user is human so that the page does not experience heavy traffic from bots.
- A text to speech feature so that users with hard visibility will be able to say the product they wish to search without having to type. 

### There are also some key requirements we as a group must meet, these are:
* Must use ReactJS.
* Must use Node.
* Must have GET route for retrieving and adding new data.
* Must deploy this application using Netlify.
* Must utilize at least two libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed.
